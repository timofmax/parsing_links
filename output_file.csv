"Answer C is correct
Which command removes all MAC addresses from port channel?
A. clear mac-address table dynamic
B. clear mac-address table dynamic address mac address
C. clear mac-address table dynamic interface interface-id
D. clear mac-address table dynamic vlan vlan-id
https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/techdoc/dc/reference/cli/nxos/commands/l2/clear-mac-address-table-dynamic.html
“If the clear mac address-table dynamic command is entered with no options, all dynamic addresses are removed.
If you specify an address but do not specify an interface, the address is deleted from all interfaces.
If you specify an interface but do not specify an address, the switch removes all addresses on the specified interfaces.”",https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/techdoc/dc/reference/cli/nxos/commands/l2/clear-mac-address-table-dynamic.html,"September 24th, 2019",@Neofly
"I call shenanigans sir! 
There is no way you got a AAA Simlet/Lab…per Cisco CCNP Switch exam topic.
“Infrastructure Security”
“2.2 Describe device security using Cisco IOS AAA with TACACS+ and RADIUS”
Per Cisco,  this is one of the only topic that you are not expected to be able to configure and verify….why you trying to scare people for no good reason….?
